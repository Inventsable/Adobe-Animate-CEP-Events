### ðŸ”¥ This panel took me 20 minutes to make from scratch thanks to [bombino](https://github.com/Inventsable/bombino) for generating the foundation and styling with ready-made [brutalism](https://github.com/battleaxedotco/brutalism) components ðŸ”¥

Panel to demonstrate otherwise undocumented CEP events [found here](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=https://www.99ku.vip/twjc/10464.html&prev=search):
